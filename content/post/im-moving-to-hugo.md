I used Wordpress to handle my website. But I have 1 problem with Wordpress, that is the admin dashboard is too overwhelming to use.

One day, I discovered Hugo from [Eric Murphy's Website](https://ericmurphy.xyz/). I looked at the Hugo's advantages and I found that Hugo is suitable for me.

So, today, I'll be using Hugo to power my website.
